# RF Classification

This github repo used 2 methods to classify signals from spectrograms.

- YOLOv5
- AFC (iCARL)

You may request the models (.pt/.pth files), documentations and reports from me at kokchinyi01@gmail.com.

## Dataset

The Dataset I used is from [Spectrogram Data Set for Deep-Learning-Based RF Frame Detection](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/12/168). Click here to download the [dataset](https://fordatis.fraunhofer.de/handle/fordatis/287) [80 gb]. You may also download it using this command (Linux).

```bash
$ wget https://fordatis.fraunhofer.de/bitstream/fordatis/287/1/spectrogram_training_data_20220711.zip
```

### Dataset Structure (KIV)

- ??
  - ?

Keep in mind that this dataset only label the signals into WLAN, Collision and BT. Please use the necessary steps below to extract out the 18 different signals from the csv files and labels.

The 18 different signals are:
| WLAN_WAC_1 | WLAN_WN_3 | WLAN_WBG_7 |
|------------ |------------ |------------------ |
| WLAN_WAC_3 | WLAN_WN_7 | BT_classic_ADH5 |
| WLAN_WAC_7 | WLAN_WBG_0 | BT_classic_AEDH5 |
| WLAN_WN_0 | WLAN_WBG_1 | BLE_2MHz_DATA |
| WLAN_WN_1 | WLAN_WBG_2 | BLE_1MHz_DATA |
| WLAN_WN_2 | WLAN_WBG_3 | BLE_1MHz_AIND |

# YOLOv5

This is a transfer learning model from the main [YOLOv5 model](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). You may also visit [link](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for more information in creating your own dataset for YOLOv5. I will only outline the steps I did for my dataset.

Note: The yolov5 folder in this repo contains other functions used to train this custom dataset. Please use the YOLOv5 given in this repo.

**KIV**

The results for the **sliced** dataset is below.

![PR Curve](readmeimages/PR_curve.png)

To accomodate slice and no slice function, I have accomodated a function for this. This is a parser argument as seen below.

```
$ python detection.py
```

KIV

# AFC

AFC model is a **CLASSIFICATION** model. [Repo link](https://github.com/kminsoo/AFC)

Note: The AFC folder in this repo contains other functions used to train this **custom** dataset such as auto scaling of images to 224x224. Please use the AFC given in this repo.

It is necessary to extract the signals images out from each frame. The steps are detailed as below.

KIV

To train the model, you may use this:

```
$ python -minclearn --options options/AFC/AFC_cnn_custom18.yaml options/data/custom18_order.yaml --initial-increment 10 --increment 2 --fixed-memory --memory-size 20000 --device 0 --label AFC_cnn_custom_10steps --data-path sample_signals --metadata-path custom_split
```

However, you may add in `save-model` and `dump-predictions` as well.

Considering a 10-2-2-2-2 split for the dataset of 18 signals, the results are as follow:

![AFC Results](readmeimages\afc_image.png)

Keep in mind that the results are saved in a .json file. So use `AFC/results_analysis.ipynb` to generate the graphs.
